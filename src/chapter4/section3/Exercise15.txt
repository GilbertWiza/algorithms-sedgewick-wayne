4.3.15

When an edge e with weight w is added to the edge-weighted graph G:

Add the edge e to the given MST and a cycle C will be formed. 
It is possible to find C with a depth-first search in O(V + E) in the MST, which is the same as O(V + V) = O(V).
Now remove the max-weight edge in C from the MST. This will generate an MST of the new graph.
Note that if the edge e is the max-weight edge in C, the MST of the new graph remains the same as the original MST.
